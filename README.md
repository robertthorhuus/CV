### Profile
I've been working with Software Design most of my career and
always try to find new exciting Software projects on my free time.
My software experience is broad working with many languages
and tools to solve complex situations in either the robust and
performance critical embedded environments at work or developing
creative and fun apps at home. I work with a test intense attitude and
like to refactor and make clear code. Version control and automated
test regression is natural for me.

My later years have led me to do more systemization. As a senior,
I have been a team leader and scrum master showing the way
forward both regarding software design/architecture but also
introducing many new tools (version control, review, testing,
automation, storage, scripting etc).

Finally I have been fortunate enough to be entrusted for acting Line
Manager several times with recruting, personnel development,
delegation, studies, reporting and prioritizations on the agenda
adding up to almost a year in experience.
